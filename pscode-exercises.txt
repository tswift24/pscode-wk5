// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Num1 % 2 = remainder
if remainder = 1 print odd
if remainder = 0 print even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) 
numbers = num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

b) 
num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 / 5 = average

c) 
minimum = num1
for each number in numbers
if number < minimum 
minimum = number

maximum = num1 
for each number in numbers
if number > maximum 
maximum = number

d)
print average "this is the average of the nuumbers"
print minimum "this is the smallest number"
print maximum "this is the largest number"
